Her work can be found in both private and corporate collections worldwide.<\/p><p><strong>“My art is about building beautiful, joyful connections with the natural world.”<\/strong><\/p><p>Claire grew up in Montreal and spent most of her summers in Vermont, the Green Mountain State. Her country home as a child was nestled in 60-acres of untamed boreal forest. Creativity in her household was encouraged. Great art was revered. Claire’s success as a fine artist was a celebrated rite of passage.  <\/p><p><strong>“I believe a keen understanding of color and its relationship to people and nature creates more beautiful places to live, work and play.”<\/strong><\/p><p>Claire’s paintings, though abstract, take their visual cues from forms, colors, textures and patterns in nature: the feathers of a bird, the shades of turquoise in the water, how the light through the trees dapples on the ground below.   <\/p><p>Beyond the canvas, Claire’s art transforms commercial and residential interiors, urban exteriors, housewares,  furniture, package design and women’s apparel. Her work has appeared in major motion pictures and popular television shows. Claire’s long-standing corporate collaborations shape and define the customer experience – most notably for retail North American retail giant Anthropologie. <\/p><p><\/p><p>In 2019, Claire launched her signature collection of women's art apparel, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clairedesjardins.com\/exhibits\/past?NewsID=382\"><em>Claire Desjardins<\/em><\/a>.
